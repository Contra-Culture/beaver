# beaver the builder

``beaver`` is a simple build tool that highly rely on CoC principle.

---

## Philosophy

Beaver is a stupid simple build tool, that relies on the following principles:

- KISS (keep it simple stupid): ``beaver`` is only responsible for replacing abstract (interface) dependencies with concrete implementations before compilation.
- CoC (conventions over configurations): ``beaver`` uses source-files naming and nesting conventions instead of complex configuration files.


## Concepts

### **Source Tree**
Source tree is a directory/file tree with all the sources of the project you want to build. ``beaver`` reads source tree, copies sources into separate directory and places correct dependency implementations together with them.

### **Implementations**

Implementation is a package that implements a dependency interface.
